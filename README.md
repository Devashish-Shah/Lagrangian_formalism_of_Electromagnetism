# Lagrangian Formalism of Electromagnetism (PH444)
#### Duration: January'23 to April'23
The following report provides a comprehensive account of the Lagrangian formalism for Electrodynamics. We first introduce the Lagrangian formalism for the massless electromagnetic fields in
section I and then move on to analyze the effects of photon mass in II. When a material enters its
superconducting state, many of its electromagnetic properties change. In section III, we investigate
one such phenomenon called the Meissner effect, in which the material behaves like a diamagnet.
We then move to the study of symmetries of the Lagrangian and the construction of the Stress-Energy tensor in section IV. This is followed by a discussion on Noether’s theorem in section V.
Section VI deals with the solution of the wave equation in covariant form constructed from Lorentz
invariant Green functions. We then study the application of the Lagrangian method to quantum
electrodynamics and study the behaviour of the t’Hooft-Polyakov magnetic monopole, elaborated
in sections VII - IX. In the final section, we construct the path integral for a spinning particle and
establish its classical dynamics to be of a massless point particle on the unit 2-sphere coupled to a
magnetic monopole field. Spin quantisation is shown to emerge as a consequence of global gauge
invariance of the spin path integral.
